# Project-1---Iris-Species-Classification-

**Abstract**
This project presents a comprehensive machine learning workflow for multi-class classification using the classic Iris flower dataset. The goal is to build, evaluate, and compare a range of classification algorithms to accurately predict iris species based on sepal and petal measurements.

The dataset comprises 150 samples of iris flowers from three species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. Each sample includes four numerical featuresâ€”sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Following data ingestion and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed using scatter plots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps to understand feature distributions and relationships. The target feature Species is then predicted using five machine learning classifiers:

1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

3. Logistic Regression

4. Decision Tree Classifier

5. Random Forest Classifier

Each model is trained on 70% of the data and tested on the remaining 30%. Performance evaluation is conducted using accuracy and macro-averaged F1 scores. Additionally, confusion matrices are plotted for each classifier to visualize model-specific prediction patterns and class-wise performance.

This project demonstrates a beginner-friendly yet thorough approach to multi-class classification using standard Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. It emphasizes comparative model evaluation and interpretability, making it an ideal reference for those new to machine learning with structured data.
